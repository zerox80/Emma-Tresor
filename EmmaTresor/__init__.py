# EmmaTresor Django Package Initialization
# ==========================================
# 
# This file marks the 'EmmaTresor' directory as a Python package.
# It allows the directory to be imported as a module in Python.
# 
# In Django projects, this file is typically empty but serves important purposes:
# - Makes the directory a proper Python package
# - Allows imports like 'from EmmaTresor import settings'
# - Required for Django to recognize this as the project root package
# 
# This file can also contain package-level initialization code if needed,
# but most Django projects keep it empty for simplicity.
